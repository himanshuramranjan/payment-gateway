1.> Bank Account class can be defined . User can have multiple bank account details
and sender receiver should choose the particular bank accounts to perform the transaction.

2.> The current design of PaymentDetails tightly couples authentication logic with a single password-based
method, which limits flexibility and scalability. It accepts only a plain string credential and performs a
simple equality check, making it difficult to support other authentication mechanisms like OTP, biometric,
or multi-factor authentication in the future.

To resolve this, we can decouple the authentication behavior from PaymentDetails by applying the
Strategy patternâ€”defining an AuthenticationStrategy interface with different implementations for password,
OTP, and other methods. PaymentDetails would then delegate authentication to the injected strategy,
allowing the system to easily extend and support various authentication types without modifying existing code,
thus adhering to the Open-Closed Principle and improving maintainability.
